# 🤔 Huh Test

`huhtest` is a test library for your [huh](https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh) forms, although it might
work for any application that allows you to specify stdin and stdout.
If you're - for some reason - eager to test your huh-based interactive CLI applications then you've come to
the right place.

## ⬇️ Installation

`go get github.com/survivorbat/huhtest`

## 📋 Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/survivorbat/gorm-deep-filtering"
)

func main() {

}

```
